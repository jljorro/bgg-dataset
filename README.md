# Boardgames Dataset RecSys 2025

Repository that contains recommender models evaluations for new dataset from BoardGameGeek.

## Installation

These scripts requires:

- Python 3.10
- CUDA 12.5

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

### Scripts

Most scripts assume this repository is downloaded in the home (~) directory. Otherwise, you need to change the path directory in scripts and configuration files.


### Recommender models tested

- *General Recommender Models*
  - Random
  - Pop
  - ItemKNN
  - UserKNN

- *Context-Aware Recommender Models:*
  - ContextRandom
  - ContextPop
  - FM
  - DeepFM

### Folders

- data: data corresponding to the dataset described in the paper, divided in ratings, continuous, and discrete, the last two with the context extracted either from metadata or reviews
- elliot: configuration files and code to use with Elliot
- evaluation: scripts to evaluate the models
- prefiltering: new implemented prefiltering methods
- recbole: configuration files and code to use with RecBole

### Elliot Experiments

The Elliot framework is used for implementing general recommendation algorithms.

#### Step 1: Hyperparameter Tuning

First, execute all scripts in the `elliot/hypertune` folder to find the best hyperparameters for each model:

```bash
cd elliot/hypertune
./run_experiments.sh
```

Alternatively, you can run each hyperparameter tuning script individually:

```bash
python run_ItemKNN.py
python run_UserKNN.py
# Continue with other hyperparameter tuning scripts
```

#### Step 2: Adapting Configuration Files

After identifying the best hyperparameters, modify the YAML configuration files in the `elliot/final` folder to incorporate these optimal values.

#### Step 3: Running Final Models

Execute the final models with the optimized configurations:

```bash
cd elliot/final
python run_ItemKNN.py
python run User_KNN.py
# Continue with other scripts
```

### RecBole Experiments

RecBole experiments require GPU acceleration for optimal performance.

#### Step 1: Hyperparameter Search

Run the Ray Tune script to search for the best hyperparameters:

```bash
cd ray
python ray_hiperparametres.py
```

**Note**: GPU usage is required for this step.

#### Step 2: Configure Final Models

Based on the results from the hyperparameter search, modify the configuration files in the `final/config/hyperparameters` directory.

#### Step 3: Execute Final Experiments

Run the CARS (Context-Aware Recommender Systems) experiments:

```bash
cd final
python execute_cars_experiment_v2.py
```

### Prefiltering

To execute the prefiltering process, run the following script:

```bash
python exec_prefiltering.py
```

This will preprocess the data according to the defined filtering criteria.

### Evaluation

After generating recommendations with each recommender system, you need to evaluate their performance.

#### Step 1: Copy Predictions

Copy the predictions generated by each recommender type to their respective evaluation folders.

#### Step 2: Run Evaluation Scripts

For each recommender type, run the evaluation script:

```bash
# For general recommenders
python evaluation/general/evaluation_script.py

# For context-aware recommenders
python evaluation/context/evaluation_script.py

# For other recommender types (if available)
python evaluation/cars_models/evaluation_script.py
```

### Examples

Here's an example workflow for a complete experiment:

1. Run hyperparameter tuning for Elliot models
2. Configure the best models in Elliot final configs
3. Run the final Elliot models to generate predictions
4. Run hyperparameter search for RecBole models using GPU
5. Configure the best RecBole models
6. Run the final RecBole CARS experiment
7. Execute prefiltering if needed
8. Run evaluation scripts for each recommender type

### Notes

- Make sure you have sufficient disk space to store the model outputs and prediction results
- GPU acceleration is strongly recommended for RecBole experiments
- Check the console output for any error messages during execution
